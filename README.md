# FOV_StencilShader
Project, showing the implemented fov system enhanced with stencil shader in Unity 2D. 

Tested on Unity 2022.3.25f1. Supports URP. Can be used in 3D and HDRP and SRP after modifications. 

Works independently of the shadow cast by lights. Can be used on tiles. 

Customisable e.g:
- view range
- view angle
- masks 
- eye mesh (e.g. detail)
- actions on visible objects

In addition, the design includes:
- player movement (input system on delagates) 
- rotation
- cinemachine
